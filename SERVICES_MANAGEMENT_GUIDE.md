## Service Statistics

At the bottom of the Services tab, you'll see:
- **Total Services**: All services in the system
- **Active**: Services currently visible on the website
- **With Images**: Services using custom images instead of icons

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use clear, professional service names
2. **Descriptions**: Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
3. **Images**: 
   - Use consistent image sizes across all services
   - Prefer SVG or PNG with transparent backgrounds
   - Optimize images for web (compress before uploading)
4. **Colors**: Choose colors that match your service specialty
5. **Order**: Arrange services by importance or alphabetically
6. **Testing**: After adding/editing, check the Services page to verify appearance

## Default Services

The system comes pre-loaded with 8 default services:
1. Cardiology (Heart icon, Red)
2. Neurology (Brain icon, Purple)
3. Emergency Medicine (Stethoscope icon, Blue)
4. Pediatrics (Baby icon, Pink)
5. Orthopedics (Bone icon, Orange)
6. Ophthalmology (Eye icon, Green)
7. Internal Medicine (Activity icon, Dark Blue)
8. Preventive Care (Shield icon, Teal)

You can edit, disable, or delete these default services as needed.

## Real-Time Updates

All changes made in the Admin Panel are immediately reflected on the public-facing Services page. No page refresh required for administrators viewing the site.

## Storage

Services data is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `phmc_medical_services`. This ensures data persists across sessions even without a backend database.

### How Uploaded Images Work

When you upload an image from your device:
1. The image is converted to **base64** format (text representation)
2. This base64 data is stored directly in localStorage with the service data
3. The image appears instantly without needing a server
4. Images persist across browser sessions
5. **Note:** Base64 images are larger than the original file size, so keep images optimized

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No server/hosting required
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ Instant upload and display
- ‚úÖ Images never break or go missing

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è localStorage has a 5-10MB limit (shared across all data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Base64 images are ~33% larger than original
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep individual images under 2MB
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is browser-specific (doesn't sync across devices)

## Troubleshooting

**Service not appearing on website:**
- Check if the service is enabled (green "Active" badge)
- Verify the service has both title and description filled
- Check browser console for any errors

**Image not displaying:**
- Verify the image URL is correct and accessible
- Check image file format (PNG, JPG, SVG supported)
- Try using a different image URL
- If using local path, ensure file is uploaded to correct directory
- For uploaded files, check file size (must be under 2MB)
- Clear browser cache and reload the page
- Try re-uploading the image

**Changes not saving:**
- Ensure all required fields are filled (marked with *)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Clear browser cache and try again
